  AutoTagMate instantly detects the word or phrase immediately before your cursorâ€”or wraps selected textâ€”with matching HTML tags. Say goodbye to tedious manual typing!

- **Automatic Tag Closure:**  
  When you type an opening tag (e.g., `<Example>`), the extension automatically inserts the corresponding closing tag (`</Example>`), ensuring your HTML is always correctly structured.

- **Customizable Activation Key:**  
  Set your preferred keyboard shortcut (such as Tab, Ctrl+P, or any combination) to trigger tag wrapping on the fly, perfectly fitting into your workflow.

- **Excluded Sites Option:**  
  Choose specific websites where you donâ€™t want AutoTagMate to run, so you get assistance only where you need it most.

- **Ideal for AI Prompt Crafting:**  
  Enhance your prompt writing for ChatGPT, Claude AI, and other neural network-based assistants by quickly formatting your instructions with clear HTML tags.

- **Clean, Modern Interface:**
